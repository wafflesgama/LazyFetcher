## Build your desired levels at an instant of a click! 🛠️
Lazy Builder is a Tool & Library designed to simplify the construction of 3D environments. 

<br/>

## Super Lightweight 🏋️
Since the tool by default does not contain any 3D assets its whole source occupies less than 5Mb. 

<br/>

## Make use of the Main Library 📦
The Lazy Builder comes with a main official library that has hundreds of CC0 Assets to help you build/prototype your levels ([more info](https://github.com/wafflesgama/LazyBuilderLibrary)).

<br/>

## Create & Add your Custom Libraries 🖋️
The tool supports the addition of custom libraries (local or remote) to expand this collective open-source library or to quickly access your private asset collection.<br/>
It has a dedicated window to help you manage & configure the library's data structure (local only).

## Get you started 🛫
Check the [Quick Start Guide](QuickGuide.md) for a brief & introductory explanation on how to use this tool.

<br/>

## How does it actually work? ⚙️
 The tool was designed to use an agnostic fetching service that reads the list of available items (**data.json**) and displays & organizes them based on their **_ItemId_** & **_ItemTypeId_** properties. As you select each Item the fetching works by following the established path (./content/**_ItemId_**/**_ItemId_**_**_ItemTypeId_**.fbx)

| Fetching Service   | In Version | Additional Info             |
|--------------------|:----------:|----------------------------:|
| Github             | 1.00       | Public repositories only    |
| Local              | 1.00       | Tested on Windows OS        |
